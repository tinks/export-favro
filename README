# Export Favro cards and information

Favro is a nice bug tracking system, but sometimes you are required to migrate to another system. This tiny Python project extracts the cards and a lot of other stuff from Favro and stores it in a local SQLite database.

When your data is in the database, it is easy to create files or calls to import it into your new bug tracking system.

## Setup

Create a `config.env` file in the root of the project, which contains the following values:

- `ORGANIZATION_ID`: the identifier for your instance in Favro
- `API_KEY`: the authorization header that needs to be sent in each request. This value can be obtained by making a sample request with your user and the API key you created in Favro for this user and reading the authorization header in the request

For example:

``` text
ORGANIZATION_ID=11a55553d38c111a579c5465
API_KEY=Basic ddduZS5zYWludC1naGlzbGFpxxxxx2t0b3Iuc2U6OW5XbDlabVVFNkRrSzU5ekpfOEJva1c2ejRjTnJNVlblablabla==
```
